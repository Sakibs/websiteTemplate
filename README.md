These are initial files for my first personal website that I have been working on since summer and will continue to work on in my free time. 
I am currently developing this on Windows with XAMPP and php to make a universal template. 
I also hope to have a blog and a forum within this website programmed with PHP. 
I also experimented with a little bit of raw jQuery to make a crude accordian in my works page. 
After I find a host I will just fill everything in.
